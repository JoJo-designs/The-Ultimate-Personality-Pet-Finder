Goal
As a group create a program that uses at least two apis and bootstrap alternitive and is interactive. It needs to have a clean user interface and a mobile frist design. 

The Idea
As a group we came up with what we wanted to do very quickly. We decided to build a website that helps match people with pets that fit their life style and personality. We wanted our site to be able to take in user responces and information on the users location.It would than use that information to call an api for pets in a user decided range that match the inputed requirements. after the infomation was resived the elements would be built onto the page and the user can view from four pets. 

Porcess
The best way the describe this projects prossess is a little rocky but releativly steady. Our frist step was to decied the APIs and technologies we wanted to work with. We wanted to use the Google Locations API plus the Petfinder API and our bootstrap alternitvie was foundations. Once we had a those the plan was to get the whole thing working before doing anything about the design of the poject. By the end out frist meeting we had a basic plan of what we wanted. In the second meeting we finallised the plans and began to divied up duties between the group. I personliy ran into some issues when trying to set up the Google Locations API. I needed to use cords and set the mode to no-cords. I tried a few thing but when nothing was working I started to look at other simaller APIs. I found a API that was eaiser to work with and had everything working. I informed the group I changed and had the new one working. the next major issue was with the Pet finder API. We were struggleing to make it work and needed to get a fair bit of extra help with it. it eventally started to work and it was fine for a day but one day when I was trying to work one it everything broke. I didn't want to but I started to look into other api that were simaller. I didn't find any that would cover all of our need but as luck would have it one of our group menbers managed to find an artical that explained it really well and using it we now had two functioning APIs. we did run into an issue with the pet API well it can be used all of North America it didn't have meny shelters in canada. We tried locations and post codes in canada but we would only get empty arrays. We started to use US cities and we get better results. after we had a mostly working project we could put everything together and start to style it. We had other issue in this process but nothing to major. The only thing I can really think of is the colour of the background and the clickable elements. We had some issues with layout too but it was mostly on the reults page. 

Outcome 
in terms of outcome I think I has some potential but it needs some work. Well it funtions how we needed it to, The design is the main issue. As a graphic design grad I think it looks cheep in a way. When I compare it to porfestional websites I think I lack a consistant direction and well I changed the background colour on the pages and the font to it matched on each page It feels detached from eachother and I say that our group failure would be in the design department. Which is smothing I am a shamed to say. after the asinment is mark I think I will need to change some of the UI.

Final Thoughts
At the begining of this assinment since I was the furthest ahead in terms of our other homework I took on the role of team leader. I think there are alot of thing I could have done better but I do think I did somethings well too. I think one thing I had done well was keeping the group in contact with eachother. We had a video meeting almost everyday except for sundays. I also think I did a decently good job at having the ideas of everyone atleast being heared out even if all of them didn't make the cut. I also think I was pertty available and taking time to explane again if someone asked me to. The thing I struggled with most was holding people to deadlines. I often wonder if I had of been willing to be a little more stricted and pushed a little more if I could have gotten a better result from the group as a whole. In the end I will never really know how the group would have reacted to that, but overal the program works and that is fantasic.
