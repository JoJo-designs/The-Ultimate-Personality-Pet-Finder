### Usage 
This app is easy to use. When user come to the website the only option is the click the large start now button. When started the program will ask some questions about what kind of pet that the user is looking for. After they answered all the questions the user is then asked for a city, postal code and a search radius in order to find the pet near them. This app sadly doesn't work with canadian postal codes despite the pet api claiming that they have participating shelters in canada.
